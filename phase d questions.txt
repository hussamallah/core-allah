Alright, Phase D is the closer. Here’s how it works in your canon:

* **Purpose:** finalize verdicts for all seven lines.
* **A-lines:** we don’t repeat the whole duel — we just give the **missing slot** from Phase B. Example: if Phase B gave you CO1 and then either CO2 or CF, Phase D supplies the remaining one so every A-line has CO1, CO2, CF completed.
* **Non-A lines:** they’ve already had CO1 → CO2 → CF in Phase C, so nothing more needed here.
* **F-severity:** if any line resolves to F at the CF step, trigger a **severity probe** (F1 / F0.5 / F0). That’s one extra item per F line.

So Phase D is two pieces:

1. **Missing slot fill** for the 3 A-lines.
2. **Severity probes** for any line that lands F.

Here’s the **Phase D bank**, formatted like the rest.

  * B: “Hide work and avoid the fight.” → F

### BONDING

**D-BOND-01-CO**

* prompt: “A close one asks for your time again tonight.”
* options:

  * A: “Say no and name a time tomorrow.” → C

  * B: “Ignore your need and keep giving.” → F

---

### STRESS

**D-STRESS-01-CO**

## Phase D — Severity Probes (F only)

These trigger **only if CF = F** on a line:

**D-SEV-01**

* phase: D
* kind: severity\_probe
* prompt: “When you froze, how strong was it?”
* options:

  * A: “It passed quick; I moved soon.” → F0.5
  * B: “It held me hard for a while.” → F1
  * C: “It stopped me fully; I did nothing.” → F0

---

That’s Phase D: missing slot coverage for each line + severity probes.

Do you want me to stitch **Phase A + B + C + D** into one continuous canonical bank now, or keep each phase separate for clarity?
