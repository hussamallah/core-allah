Alright, Phase C is the **four non-selected lines**. Each one runs a fixed sequence:

* **CO1** → firmness vs softness
* **CO2** → another firmness vs softness
* **CF** → firmness vs fail (only after an O has been seeded)

That means we need **3 items per line** × 7 lines = 21 slots total. But because in Phase C we only ever use 4 lines (the ones not picked in Phase A), we still need a full set for all 7 so the engine can rotate.

Here’s the full **Phase C bank (21 items)** in the same structure you approved.
